1: It's the remainder math function in java. 
2: This makes my brain hurt because ?: is a ternary operator, a shortcut of if-then. 8%3 is not boolean, 
and it does not evaluate to true or false. 
3: 2,147,483,647 is the max value for an integer. So the answer would be (2,147,483,647 - 5) for the 
number of possible results.
4. Numbers 0 through 2,147,483,647. I am assuming in all of this that you cannot get remainders out of
negative numbers.
